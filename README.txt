This project was developed as part of the Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence course by Maven Analytics.
The goal was to design a complete Business Intelligence solution for a fictional company called Adventure Works Cycles, including data transformation, modeling, and interactive dashboards.

Performed data cleaning and transformation using Power Query.

Applied pivot/unpivot operations, merges, and data type adjustments.

Standardized date and text fields for consistency.

Applied DAX functions like CALCULATE(), SUMX(), DIVIDE(), FILTER(), and time intelligence functions.

Built dynamic KPIs and context-aware calculations.

Visualization & Dashboard Design

Designed interactive dashboards with slicers, cards, and dynamic visuals.

Used consistent color palettes and layout for clear storytelling.

Built views for Sales Overview, Regional Performance, and Product Analysis.

Key Insights & Results

Interactive dashboard allowing users to explore sales performance by region, product, and time period.
